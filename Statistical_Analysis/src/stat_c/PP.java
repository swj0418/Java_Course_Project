 * Portfolio Class.
 * I originally designed SStat Class to convey statistics for two stock data, but it would incur too much lines of code in one class.
 * It turns out, however, I remembered that if I wanted to construct a portfolio that contains more than two stocks,
 *  I didn't have to put every stocks altogether, but rather, I could update them by adding in single stock data.
